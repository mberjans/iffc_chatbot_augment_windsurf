# Nexus Scholar AI - Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Nexus Scholar AI project.

## Foundational Setup (Agent: DATA_PREP)

### Ticket ID: NXS-0Z-001 - Create PubMed XML Downloader/Fetcher

Completed on: June 10, 2025

Implemented functions:
- `download_pubmed_xml(pubmed_id=None, output_path=".")`: Main function to download PubMed XML by PubMed ID
- `construct_pubmed_xml_url(pubmed_id)`: Helper to build the primary download URL
- `download_from_pubmed_central(pubmed_id, output_path=".")`: Alternative download method using NCBI eUtils API
- `is_valid_pubmed_id(pubmed_id)`: Simple validation function for PubMed IDs

Features:
- Downloads PubMed XML documents using direct URL or eUtils API
- Falls back to alternative download method when primary fails
- Validates PubMed IDs
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Saves XML files with consistent naming convention

### Ticket ID: NXS-1Z-001: PubMed XML Parser Utility

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Implemented functions:
- `parse_pubmed_xml(xml_file_path)`: Main function to parse a PubMed XML file and extract structured data
- `load_xml_from_file(xml_file_path)`: Load and parse an XML file into an lxml ElementTree
- `extract_metadata(xml_tree)`: Extract key metadata (PMID, DOI, title, journal info, authors, etc.)
- `extract_abstract(xml_tree)`: Extract abstract text with fallbacks for different XML structures
- `extract_full_text(xml_tree)`: Extract the full text content from a PubMed XML document
- `extract_sections(xml_tree)`: Extract distinct sections from a PubMed XML document
- `clean_text(text)`: Helper function to clean and normalize text content

Features:
- Comprehensive metadata extraction including authors, publication dates, journal info
- Robust abstract extraction with multiple fallback approaches for different XML formats
- Full-text extraction from PubMed XML
- Section identification and extraction
- Text normalization and cleaning
- Error handling for malformed or missing XML

## Knowledge Augmentation Development (Agent: KAG_DEV)

### Ticket ID: NXS-1A-001 - Implement KAG-Builder: XML to Knowledge Graph

#### Task: KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-DEFINE_KG_SCHEMA

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Implemented in `kg_schema.py`:

**Entity Types:**
Enhanced the biomedical knowledge graph schema with comprehensive entity types including:
- Basic entities: DRUG, DISEASE, GENE, PROTEIN, PATHWAY
- Clinical entities: SYMPTOM, ANATOMY, CLINICAL_FEATURE
- Biological entities: ORGANISM, CELL_TYPE, METABOLITE
- Process entities: BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS, METHOD
- Chemical entities: CHEMICAL

Each entity type includes:
- Description: Detailed explanation of the entity type
- Examples: Representative samples to guide entity extraction

**Relation Types:**
Implemented a comprehensive set of relationship types including:
- Treatment relationships: TREATS
- Causal relationships: CAUSES, ACTIVATES, INHIBITS
- Associative relationships: ASSOCIATED_WITH, INTERACTS_WITH, COOCCURS_WITH
- Structural relationships: PART_OF
- Biological relationships: EXPRESSED_IN, CONVERTS_TO, BIOMARKER_FOR, REGULATES, METABOLIZED_BY, USED_IN

Each relation type includes:
- Description: Detailed explanation of the relationship
- Subject/object type constraints: Lists of valid entity types for each position
- Examples: Representative triplets to guide relation extraction

**Utility Functions:**
Implemented schema validation and query functions:
- `get_all_entity_types()`: Get list of all entity type names
- `get_all_relation_types()`: Get list of all relation type names
- `get_entity_description()`: Get description for a specific entity type
- `get_relation_description()`: Get description for a specific relation type
- `is_valid_entity_type()`: Check if an entity type is valid in the schema
- `is_valid_relation()`: Validate if a relation triplet conforms to schema constraints
- `get_valid_relation_types_between()`: Find valid relationships between two entity types
- `get_entity_examples()`: Get examples for an entity type
- `get_relation_example()`: Get an example for a relation type
- `get_relation_subject_types()`: Get valid subject types for a relation
- `get_relation_object_types()`: Get valid object types for a relation

The schema is designed to support the Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG) pattern with mutual indexing between the knowledge graph and source text for accurate citation generation.

#### Task: KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-CHOOSE_KG_LIBRARY

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Selected NetworkX as the knowledge graph library for the KAG module implementation.

**Key features that led to choosing NetworkX:**
- **Graph Types**: Supports multiple graph types including directed graphs and multigraphs (MultiDiGraph), which are essential for representing complex biomedical relationships where multiple edges can exist between the same nodes.
- **Python Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and offers a Pythonic API.
- **Serialization**: Provides built-in methods for graph serialization with `node_link_data()` and deserialization with `node_link_graph()`, facilitating easy saving/loading of knowledge graphs.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Rich set of graph algorithms for path finding, centrality measures, and community detection.
- **Lightweight**: In-memory graph representation that's efficient for the project's requirements.
- **Extensibility**: Allows custom node and edge attributes which is critical for storing entity types, relations, and mutual indexing references.

**Implementation in `kg_builder.py`:**
- Used MultiDiGraph for the knowledge graph implementation to support multiple relationship types between entities
- Implemented graph creation, node/edge addition, and serialization methods
- Provided utility functions for graph traversal and querying
