## Knowledge Augmentation Development (Agent: KAG_DEV)

### Ticket ID: NXS-1A-001 - Implement KAG-Builder: XML to Knowledge Graph

#### Task: KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-DEFINE_KG_SCHEMA

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Implemented in `kg_schema.py`:

**Entity Types:**
Enhanced the biomedical knowledge graph schema with comprehensive entity types including:
- Basic entities: DRUG, DISEASE, GENE, PROTEIN, PATHWAY
- Clinical entities: SYMPTOM, ANATOMY, CLINICAL_FEATURE
- Biological entities: ORGANISM, CELL_TYPE, METABOLITE
- Process entities: BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS, METHOD
- Chemical entities: CHEMICAL

Each entity type includes:
- Description: Detailed explanation of the entity type
- Examples: Representative samples to guide entity extraction

**Relation Types:**
Implemented a comprehensive set of relationship types including:
- Treatment relationships: TREATS
- Causal relationships: CAUSES, ACTIVATES, INHIBITS
- Associative relationships: ASSOCIATED_WITH, INTERACTS_WITH, COOCCURS_WITH
- Structural relationships: PART_OF
- Biological relationships: EXPRESSED_IN, CONVERTS_TO, BIOMARKER_FOR, REGULATES, METABOLIZED_BY, USED_IN

Each relation type includes:
- Description: Detailed explanation of the relationship
- Subject/object type constraints: Lists of valid entity types for each position
- Examples: Representative triplets to guide relation extraction

**Utility Functions:**
Implemented schema validation and query functions:
- `get_all_entity_types()`: Get list of all entity type names
- `get_all_relation_types()`: Get list of all relation type names
- `get_entity_description()`: Get description for a specific entity type
- `get_relation_description()`: Get description for a specific relation type
- `is_valid_entity_type()`: Check if an entity type is valid in the schema
- `is_valid_relation()`: Validate if a relation triplet conforms to schema constraints
- `get_valid_relation_types_between()`: Find valid relationships between two entity types
- `get_entity_examples()`: Get examples for an entity type
- `get_relation_example()`: Get an example for a relation type
- `get_relation_subject_types()`: Get valid subject types for a relation
- `get_relation_object_types()`: Get valid object types for a relation

The schema is designed to support the Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG) pattern with mutual indexing between the knowledge graph and source text for accurate citation generation.

#### Task: KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-CHOOSE_KG_LIBRARY

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Selected NetworkX as the knowledge graph library for the KAG module implementation.

**Key features that led to choosing NetworkX:**
- **Graph Types**: Supports multiple graph types including directed graphs and multigraphs (MultiDiGraph), which are essential for representing complex biomedical relationships where multiple edges can exist between the same nodes.
- **Python Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and offers a Pythonic API.
- **Serialization**: Provides built-in methods for graph serialization with `node_link_data()` and deserialization with `node_link_graph()`, facilitating easy saving/loading of knowledge graphs.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Rich set of graph algorithms for path finding, centrality measures, and community detection.
- **Lightweight**: In-memory graph representation that's efficient for the project's requirements.
- **Extensibility**: Allows custom node and edge attributes which is critical for storing entity types, relations, and mutual indexing references.

**Implementation in `kg_builder.py`:**
- Used MultiDiGraph for the knowledge graph implementation to support multiple relationship types between entities
- Implemented graph creation, node/edge addition, and serialization methods
- Provided utility functions for graph traversal and querying

#### Task: KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-SETUP_NER_TOOL

Completed on: June 11, 2025

Implemented in `ner_extractor.py`:

Set up spaCy with biomedical models for named entity recognition in biomedical texts.

**Core Functions:**
- `download_biomedical_model()`: Downloads the biomedical NER model for spaCy if not already available, with multiple fallback methods.
- `setup_spacy_model()`: Sets up and returns the spaCy model for biomedical NER, with fallbacks to simpler models if needed.
- `map_ner_to_schema()`: Maps NER entity types from spaCy to our custom schema entity types.
- `extract_entities_with_ner()`: Extracts entities from text using spaCy NER, returning a list with type, text, and position information.
- `extract_entities_from_sections_with_ner()`: Processes multiple document sections using NER.
- `extract_entities_from_parsed_xml_with_ner()`: Extracts entities from parsed PubMed XML data structure.
- `merge_entity_extractions()`: Merges entities from rule-based and NER approaches, handling duplicates.

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `en_core_sci_md` as the primary biomedical model
- Implements entity type mapping between spaCy's biomedical entities and our custom schema
- Handles model download and installation if not available
- Provides fallback mechanisms to simpler models when necessary
- Extracts entity metadata including normalized text, position, and type

**Schema Integration:**
- Maps extracted entities to our defined schema entity types
- DEFAULT_ENTITY_MAPPING provides the connection between spaCy entity labels and our schema
- Integration with the knowledge graph schema for consistent entity typing
